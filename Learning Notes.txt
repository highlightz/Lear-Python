Q: Why does "test" and "test" return "test" or 1 and 1 return 1 instead of True?
A: Python and many languages like to return one of the operands to their boolean expressions,
rather than just True or False. 
This means that if you did False and 1 you get the first operand (False),
but if you do True and 1 your get the second (1). 

A colon at the end of a line is how you tell Python you are going to create a new "block" of code, 
and then indenting four spaces tells Python what lines of code are in that block. 

Every if-statement must have an else.

The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.

Code a little, run a little, fix a little.

The best way to work on a piece of software is in small chunks like this:
1.On a sheet of paper or an index card, write a list of tasks you need to complete to finish the software. 
This is your to do list.
2.Pick the easiest thing you can do from your list.
3.Write out English comments in your source file as a guide for how you would accmplish this task in your code.
4.Write some of the code under the English comments.
5.Quickly run your script so see if that code worked.
6.Keep working in a cycle of writing some code, running it to test it, and fixing it until it works.
7.Cross this task off your list, then pick your next easiest task and repeat.
