Q: Why does "test" and "test" return "test" or 1 and 1 return 1 instead of True?
A: Python and many languages like to return one of the operands to their boolean expressions,
rather than just True or False. 
This means that if you did False and 1 you get the first operand (False),
but if you do True and 1 your get the second (1). 

A colon at the end of a line is how you tell Python you are going to create a new "block" of code, 
and then indenting four spaces tells Python what lines of code are in that block. 

Every if-statement must have an else.

The best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.

Code a little, run a little, fix a little.
